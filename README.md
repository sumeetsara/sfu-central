# Project Name: SFU CENTRAL
<h2>Current Problem:</h2> No current platform exists that connects SFU students. While some student-run platforms such as the SFU Facebook/Discord/Reddit exist, they are often disconnected and hard to use. The Facebook group suffers from difficulty joining groups, Reddit is often isolated and can be brigaded by people who are not from SFU, and the Discord page suffers from an extremely small user base. By creating a centralized online platform, SFU students will have a single tool that they can use to connect with their peers, ranging from personal use to academic use.
